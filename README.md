# Machine Learning for Inverse Problems and Data Assimilation

## Tutorials developed by Ricardo Baptista
## Collaboration with Eviatar Bach, Andrew Stuart, Daniel Sanz-Alonso

The code is developed using PyTorch. We include an application to Biochemical Oxygen demand model for inverse problems and an application to Lorenz-96 system for data assimilation.

## Inverse Problems
1. Variational Inference with Gaussians
2. Variational Inference with Transport Maps
3. Data Amortization in Inverse Problems

## Data Assimilation for Learning Filters
1. Application to 3DVar
